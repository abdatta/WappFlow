description: Commit to Git
---

Your goal is to generate a perfect commit message and then commit to git.
You will do this based on:

1. The diff changes.
2. The current chat thread details (or in case there was a commit done in between the chat, include the portion since last commit).
   Your commit message should:
3. Have a main header that gives a short crisp outline of the changes
4. This should be followed by bulletted details.
5. No. of bullets can range from 0 to 9 based on amount of change. Chose wisely, preferably less bullets where they cover enough.
6. Also bullets are optional for tiny changes that can be aptly described in single line.
